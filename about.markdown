Hello...!

Welcome to my jekyll blog.

This blog is to record my thoughts and experiences in life.

There are 3 categories that I will generally focus on:
 - general: topics that are related to maybe... life?
 - tech: topics that I've used and what I think about them... (they will not be manuals or guides)
 - random: topics that just happen to be in my head at the time of writing 

 Yeah... well, I am interested in Data Engineering, Backend Development, and Networks
