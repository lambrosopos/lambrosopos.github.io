## Hi...

This is just a post to record my current interests.

As of now, I'm studying Hadoop ecosystem. Trying to grasp the diverse platforms and frameworks isn't very easy...
But, it is fun, getting to know about how big data is being managed, what people have tried and the future of data and stuff

Quickly realizing though that nothing can be an 'all-rounder tool' if you want to have an interactive SQL with fast responsive times, sacrifices will have to be made. Well, as of current technology advances.
Considering the future even it's quite hard to ignore the physical science behind all this.

In hadoop there are different tools you can use to manage the clusters and I'm starting to feel that even though you can't be a professional in all of them, at least you have to know how each of them work.
