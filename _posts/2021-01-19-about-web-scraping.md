## Previous Thoughts

I actually didn't know the subtle differences between web scraping and web crawling.

In fact, I used scrapy, beautifulsoup, selenium etc and just thought that the objective of them all was to gather information.

But, recently I had an opportunity to get to know more about the differences between the two. According to some sources, web scraping is more about automation and information gathering while web crawling leans more towards indexing website on the WWW.

The truth is, thinking about it, it does kind of make sense to differentiate the two. Their objectives are different and from this difference the functionalities also probably shift with them.

## Some other stuff...

Another important factor in scraping and crawling is javascript. Although yes, you can crawl and scrape with other languages, the web browser uses javascript to function. Thus, it can be fair to claim that javascript can be closer to comfortable interaction when dealing with web related activities.
